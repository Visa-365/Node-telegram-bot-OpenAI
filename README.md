# Node-telegram-bot-OpenAI
This chatbot is a bot that uses the OpenAI API to create responses. When the '/start' message is received, the bot is activated and sends a message with the given text, and then when other messages are received, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a response. You can communicate with the bot in almost any widely used language.
